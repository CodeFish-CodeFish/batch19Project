            INTERFACE:

            Interface is declared using "interface" keyword.

            An interface in Java is a template that can be used to implement a class.
            It is like contract that specifies what methods a class MUST implement.

            Interface is implemented using "implements" keyword.

            A concrete class can extend only a single class (abstract or concrete),
            but can implement multiple interfaces.

            Interface my contain method signatures and static methods but cannot contain method
            implementation/s.
