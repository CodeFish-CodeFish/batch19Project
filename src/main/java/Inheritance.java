                INHERITANCE

                Fundamental OOP concept that allows the subclass (child class) to inherit the properties (variables/fields)
                and behaviors (methods/functions) from superclass (parent class)

                Superclass (parent class) -- the class whose features are inherited.
                Subclass (child class) -- the class that inherits the superclass's features.
                "extends" is the keyword used in JAVA to create a subclass.


                Advantages of inheritance:

                * Code reusability - inheritance promotes code reusability. Subclasses can use methods and variables
                                    from the superclass without rewriting the code again.

                * Method overriding - subclasses can override methods from superclass.
                    When a method is overidden, it cannot have an access modifier more restrictive than the super class method (which is getting overriden).
                    The access modifier of the subclass method should be same or less restrictive.

                * Maintainability - easier to maintain and modify code since changes in the superclass affect all subclasses.
