public class Abstraction {

    /*
            OOP:

            * Inheritance
            * Polymorphism
            * Abstraction
            * Encapsulation

            Abstraction is a concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the high level or necessary
            features of an object.

            KEYWORD: "abstract"

            Abstract class is not a concrete class and marked with keyword "abstract".

            Abstract class can have zero, one or more abstract method/s and/or concrete methods.

            Abstract method is a method defined with a keyword "abstract" and has no implementation ( no method body ).

            An abstract class cannot be instantiated ( we cannot create an object of an abstract class ).
            Abstract class serves as a base to its subclasses.

            TASK:

            * Create an abstract class of your choice ( 2 abstract methods )
            * Extend that class
            * Override and implement those methods

            Importance of abstraction:

            1. Simplifies coding: by focusing on what an object does instead of how it does it, abstraction reduces complexity.
            2. Enhances re-usability: promotes reusing the components and code.
            3. Increases flexibility: makes your code adaptable to changes.


            TASK:

            * Create an abstract class of your choice
            * Include 1 abstract method and 1 concrete method
            * Extend the abstract class in 2 concrete classes
            * Provide implementation/override the abstract methods

            * Create an object of those concrete classes


            NOTE: Abstract class may contain final method, but that method will not be allowed to override.

            IMPORTANT POINT:

            * Final method cannot be overridden
            * Final class cannot be extended
            * Final variable's value cannot be reassigned
